  <h1>Training Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    We will be asking you to use two different strategies to change your perception of a few videos.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Situation Rethinking</strong> is about changing how you interpret the events of a situation so you feel less negative.<br>
    <em>e.g.</em> You see a video of some people falling and injuring themselves, but you tell yourself that it was likely just a stunt and no one got hurt.<br>
    <em>e.g.</em> You see a video of someone berating another person, but you tell yourself they are only doing it because they care about the other person and want them to be safe.<br>
    <br>
    When you see the label <strong>Situation Rethinking</strong> after watching a video, use this strategy to decrease your negative emotions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br><strong>Goal Rethinking</strong> is about realizing how a negative event might actually serve other goals.<br>
    <em>e.g.</em> You see a movie where someone is crying, but you tell yourself the video is helping you practice using empathy.<br>
    <em>e.g.</em> You see a video of a car crash, but you tell yourself you now know to avoid similar situations in your life.<br>
    <br>
    When you see the label <strong>Goal Rethinking</strong> after watching a video, use this strategy to decrease your negative emotions.
